# ISOMAP
## Non-Linear Model Reduction 

### TL;DR
ISOMAP is a non-linear model reduction method to reduce the size and complexity
of a dataset, projecting it onto a new plain. This method is useful for datasets
with non-linear structure, where
[PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) and [MDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling) will not be appropriate. 

### Dimension Reduction
Dimension reduction is used in when we have very high-dimensional data, which is
to say many columns or features. This often appears with image processing or
biometric processing.
